# TikTok video statistics collector

This script collects statistics from TikTok videos, using the opensource library https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api.

## Setup

This project was built with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for a better dependency management.

Run the command `bash setup.sh` on the root folder and all the dependencies will be properly installed.

## Run

Run the command `python main.py <URL>` to start the script. The statistics will be printed on the screen. 

Make sure to type a clean URL without any query parameters, like the following: `https://www.tiktok.com/@____wahid0/video/7080579870845144347`.
